	abstract = {Prior work has demonstrated that watching videos at faster speeds does not significantly impair learning in younger adults; however, it was previously unclear how increased video speed impacts memory in older adults. Additionally, we investigated the effects of increased video speed on mind-wandering. We presented younger and older adults with a pre-recorded video lecture and manipulated the video to play at different speeds. After watching the video, participants predicted their performance on a memory test covering the material from the video and then completed said memory test. We demonstrated that although younger adults can watch lecture videos at faster speeds without significant deficits in memory, older adults’ test performance is generally impaired when watching at faster speeds. Additionally, faster playback speeds seem to reduce mind-wandering (and mind-wandering was generally reduced in older adults relative to younger adults), potentially contributing to younger adults’ preserved memory at faster speeds. Thus, while younger adults can watch videos at faster speeds without significant consequences, we advise against older adults watching at faster speeds.},

	abstract = {Increasing the playback speed of video lectures is popular amongst students as a time saving strategy, but does this negatively impact test performance? Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of increasing video lecture playback speed on content test performance. A meta-regression with robust variance estimation was used to aggregate data from 110 effect sizes, stemming from 24 studies of learning from lecture videos. The results demonstrated that increasing the playback speed of lectures can negatively impact content test performance, but this cost is small (and often non-significant) for speeds 1.5 x and slower. In addition, we found no evidence of moderation of this cost by a number of theoretically important variables (e.g., test type, lecture duration). These results contribute important insights into a popular study strategy and one that is likely to be a mainstay in educational settings for years to come.},

Using an experimental design, we present the results of a pre-registered study that assigns users to watch videos at either 1.0x or 1.25x speed. We find that students who consume sped content are more likely to get better grades in a course, attempt more content, and obtain more certificates. We also find that when videos are sped up, students spend less time consuming videos and are marginally more likely to complete more video content. These findings suggest that future study of playback speed as a tool for optimizing video content for {MOOCs} is warranted. Applications for reinforcement learning and adaptive content are discussed.},

	abstract = {We presented participants with lecture videos at different speeds and tested immediate and delayed (1 week) comprehension. Results revealed minimal costs incurred by increasing video speed from 1x to 1.5x, or 2x speed, but performance declined beyond 2x speed. We also compared learning outcomes after watching videos once at 1x or twice at 2x speed. There was not an advantage to watching twice at 2x speed but if participants watched the video again at 2x speed immediately before the test, compared with watching once at 1x a week before the test, comprehension improved. Thus, increasing the speed of videos (up to 2x) may be an efficient strategy, especially if students use the time saved for additional studying or rewatching the videos, but learners should do this additional studying shortly before an exam. However, these trends may differ for videos with different speech rates, complexity or difficulty, and audiovisual overlap.},

	shorttitle = {Live Lecture Versus Video-Recorded Lecture},
	abstract = {Purpose 
          In light of educators’ concerns that lecture attendance in medical school has declined, the authors sought to assess students’ perceptions, evaluations, and motivations concerning live lectures compared with accelerated, video-recorded lectures viewed online.
          Method 
          The authors performed a cross-sectional survey study of all first- and second-year students at Harvard Medical School. Respondents answered questions regarding their lecture attendance; use of class and personal time; use of accelerated, video-recorded lectures; and reasons for viewing video-recorded and live lectures. Other questions asked students to compare how well live and video-recorded lectures satisfied learning goals.
          Results 
          Of the 353 students who received questionnaires, 204 (58\%) returned responses. Collectively, students indicated watching 57.2\% of lectures live, 29.4\% recorded, and 3.8\% using both methods. All students have watched recorded lectures, and most (88.5\%) have used video-accelerating technologies. When using accelerated, video-recorded lecture as opposed to attending lecture, students felt they were more likely to increase their speed of knowledge acquisition (79.3\% of students), look up additional information (67.7\%), stay focused (64.8\%), and learn more (63.7\%).
          Conclusions 
          Live attendance remains the predominant method for viewing lectures. However, students find accelerated, video-recorded lectures equally or more valuable. Although educators may be uncomfortable with the fundamental change in the learning process represented by video-recorded lecture use, students’ responses indicate that their decisions to attend lectures or view recorded lectures are motivated primarily by a desire to satisfy their professional goals. A challenge remains for educators to incorporate technologies students find useful while creating an interactive learning culture.},
